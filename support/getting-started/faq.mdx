  <Accordion title="Why Cantaê?">
    People who enjoy karaoke want convenience, musical fidelity, practicality, and low cost. Today, there are various solutions on the market, from electronic devices, computer programs, and smartphone apps to specialized bars. The problem is that many of these solutions tend to be expensive, the quality of the music is not always faithful to the original version, and updating the library depends on the manufacturer through the sale of updates or new products. Today, with the advancement of artificial intelligence technology, it is possible to completely remove the vocals from a song while maintaining sound fidelity.

  <Accordion title="Why are the album images missing or the song and artist names incorrect?">
    If you are experiencing issues with missing album images or incorrect song and artist names, it is likely due to problems with the ID3 tags of your music files. ID3 tags are metadata containers that store information such as the title, artist, album, and album artwork for audio files. Here are a few reasons why these issues might occur:

    - Missing or Incorrect ID3 Tags: If the ID3 tags are missing or incorrectly filled, the software cannot display the correct information. This includes missing album artwork and incorrect song or artist names.

    - Corrupted ID3 Tags: Sometimes, ID3 tags can become corrupted, causing the software to be unable to read the metadata properly.
    - Inconsistent ID3 Tag Versions: There are different versions of ID3 tags (e.g., ID3v1, ID3v2), and inconsistencies between these versions can lead to display issues.

    Solution:
    To resolve these issues, you can update or correct the ID3 tags of your music files. Here are some steps you can take:

    - Use a Tag Editor: There are many tag editor tools available that allow you to manually update and correct the ID3 tags. Some popular ones include [Mp3tag](https://www.mp3tag.de), [MusicBrainz Picard](https://picard.musicbrainz.org/), and [TagScanner](https://www.xdlab.ru).

    - Automated Tagging Software: Use automated tagging software that can fetch the correct metadata from online databases. These tools can automatically update the ID3 tags with accurate information.

    - Check File Compatibility: Ensure that your music files are in a compatible format and the ID3 tags are correctly formatted according to the standards supported by Cantaê.
