## How to add songs

There are two ways to add songs to the application:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Empty directories" icon="square-1">
    Click on button <button className="bg-primary rounded-md text-white px-2 py-1 text-sm">Add Songs</button> and select the directory where the songs are located.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Settings music directories" icon="square-2">
    Navigate to [Settings](/documentation/getting-started/pages/settings) -> click on the tab <span className="text-gray-800 dark:text-white">Music Directories</span> and on button <button className="bg-primary rounded-md text-white px-2 py-1 text-sm">Add Directory</button>
